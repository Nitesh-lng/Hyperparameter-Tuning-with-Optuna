# Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna

## Overview
This repository contains a project demonstrating hyperparameter tuning using Optuna. The dataset used is for breast cancer detection, and the model is trained using PyTorch. Optuna is leveraged to optimize hyperparameters and improve performance.

## Features
- Uses `Optuna` for automated hyperparameter tuning
- Data preprocessing with `pandas` and `sklearn`
- Model training with `torch.nn`
- Efficient data handling with `DataLoader`

## Installation
To set up the project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Hyperparameter_Tuning_Optuna.ipynb`.
2. Follow the steps inside the notebook to preprocess data, define the model, and perform hyperparameter tuning.
3. Evaluate the model performance and select the best hyperparameters.

## Dependencies
See `requirements.txt` for a full list of dependencies.
